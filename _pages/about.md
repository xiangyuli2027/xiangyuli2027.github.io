Hello, I'm Xiangyu Li, a second-year Ph.D. student in Transportation Engineering at Northwestern University (NU) under the guidance of Prof. Hani Mahmassani. Concurrently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Engineering, expecting to graduate in June 2025. I hold a Master's degree in Transportation Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and a Bachelor's degree from Beijing Jiaotong University. My research focuses on designing adaptive, predictive, and generative algorithms by leveraging advanced optimization and AI techniques to enhance transportation systems.
