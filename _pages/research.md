Dec. 2023 – Present <br/>
Northwestern University, Transportation Center <br/>
**Ongoing Project**: An Adaptive Longitudinal Driving Assistance System based on Reinforcement Learning
> * Built a cyber-physical system to train an autonomous driving system that better aligns with human preferences
> * Incorporated the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to optimize car-following behavior
